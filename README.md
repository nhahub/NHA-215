## 📖 Overview

**This repository contains the Frontend source code** for the Intelligent Career Advisor platform.

The system is designed to democratize access to advanced career intelligence. It bridges the gap between complex **Deep Learning models** and end-users by providing a seamless, responsive interface for resume auditing, semantic job matching, and interview preparation.

The application connects to a **Deployed Live Python AI Engine** to perform real-time NLP tasks, ensuring that heavy computations are handled server-side while keeping the client fast and lightweight.

## ✨ Key Features

### 👤 User Experience & Management

- **Secure Authentication:** Robust Login/Sign-up system powered by **Firebase Auth**.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A centralized hub visualizing real-time market data and analytical history using **Nivo Charts**.
- **Profile Customization:** Comprehensive settings to manage personal details and job preferences.
- **Job Viewer & Tracker:** A fully interactive CRUD dashboard to manage your job application process. You can add job titles, company names, and update application statuses (Applied, Interviewing, Offer) with real-time Firestore synchronization.

### 🧠 AI-Powered Capabilities (Integrated)

- **Smart Resume Analysis:** Upload PDF CVs to receive detailed, AI-driven feedback (ATS Score, Formatting, Content) via our integrated **Gemini 2.5** pipeline.
- **Semantic Job Matching:** Connects to our vector-based engine (using **BERT** & **FAISS**) to recommend jobs based on skill similarity.
- **Interview Simulation:** An interactive bot environment to practice technical questions.
- **Market Insights:** Live clustering and visualization of job market trends.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project leverages a modern, high-performance technology stack:

### 💻 Frontend (Current Repo)

- **Framework:** React 19, Vite, React Router Dom (v7).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons), React Spring (Animations).
- **Visualization:** Nivo Charts (@nivo/bar, line, pie), Recharts, React Circular Progressbar.

### ⚙️ Backend & Infrastructure

- **BaaS:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database) - _Fully Deployed_.
- **AI Integration:** The frontend consumes live RESTful APIs hosted on our cloud infrastructure.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Since the backend and database are already deployed, you only need to run the frontend to test the application.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YE-19/NHA-215.git](https://github.com/YE-19/NHA-215.git)
    cd NHA-215
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Project**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The app will launch locally at `http://localhost:5173` and automatically connect to our live backend servers.
